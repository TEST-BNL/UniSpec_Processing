Introduction
==========================

The purpose of this package is to provide an automated system for generating useful, usable data from dual channel spectrometer data.  It has been developed for the Unispec-DC data format, though only the :func:`~BasicProcessing.UnispecProcessing.ReadFiles` would need to be modified to import data in an alternative format.
